# Segmentation of Brain MRI Using Advanced Deep Learning Models: PSPNet and UNet-EfficientNetB7

---

## **Abstract**
Brain tumor segmentation is a critical task in medical imaging. This project focuses on segmenting Low-Grade Gliomas (LGGs) in brain MRI scans using advanced deep learning models, PSPNet and UNet-EfficientNetB7. The models were evaluated for segmentation performance using Dice score, IoU, and accuracy. The project demonstrated that transfer learning significantly outperforms models trained from scratch.
